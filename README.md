## Overview

### The challenge

Create a web application that consumes the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) and displays products dynamically. The main goal is to list products on the main page and add a timer for each product, which will disable the purchase button when the time runs out.

Each product must be displayed in a card that includes:

- Title
- Image
- Price
- Description
- Category
- Purchase button (with a timer)

Each product will have a random countdown timer (between 1 and 3 minutes).
Once the time runs out, the "Buy" button should be disabled and non-clickable.
